How to Contribute
-----------------
### Found a bug?
Just open an issue and tell us what broke. Screenshots help!

### Have an idea?
Open an issue and let's chat about it. No idea is too small or too big.

### Want to code?
1.  Make a branch: git checkout -b whatever-you-want-to-call-it
2.  Do your thing
3.  Commit: git commit -m "did a thing"
4.  Push and make a PR

Lint & Format
-------------
Code quality is managed by ESLint and Prettier. Run `npm run setup` to configure
your environment to automatically lint and format your staged changes on each commit.
You can optionally pass `--no-verify` to skip the pre-commit hook. Ex: `git commit -m "fix bug" --no-verify`

Guidelines (but not rules)
--------------------------
*   Try to write clean code that others can understand
*   Test your changes before submitting
*   Be nice to people
*   If you're not sure about something, just ask!
